# README

## Overview

This repository serves as an appendix to the paper titled "The 3-dicritical semi-complete digraphs." The content herein is a collaborative effort by Frédéric Havet, Florian Hörsch and Lucas Picasarri-Arrieta.

## Usage

To validate and complete the proofs outlined in Propositions 15 and 16, as well as Lemmas 18 and 20 from the paper, execute the following SageMath files:

- `1_proposition15.sage`
- `2_proposition16.sage`
- `3_lemma18.sage`
- `4_lemma20.sage`

## Execution Instructions

1. Ensure that SageMath is installed on your system.
2. Open a SageMath prompt.
3. Execute the chosen file by running the following command:
   ```bash
   load("xxx/yyy.sage")
   ```
Replace "xxx/yyy.sage" with the correct path to the respective SageMath file.

## File Descriptions

The execution of `1_proposition15.sage` generates the files:

- `T1.pajek` (corresponding to tournament T^1)
- `T2.pajek` (corresponding to tournament T^2)
- `T3.pajek` (corresponding to tournament T^3)
- `T4.pajek` (corresponding to tournament T^4)

These files are integral to the completion of the specified propositions and lemmas.

## Dependencies

Make sure to have SageMath installed on your system to execute the provided SageMath files.
