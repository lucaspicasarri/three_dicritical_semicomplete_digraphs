Appendix to the papers "The 3-dicritical semi-complete digraphs". 
This is a joint work with Frédéric Havet and Florian Hörsch.
Executing the files 1\_proposition15.sage, 2\_proposition16.sage, 3\_lemma18.sage and 4\_lemma20.sage completes the proofs of Propositions 15,16 and Lemmas 18,20 of the paper.
The files T1.pajek, T2.pajek, T3.pajek and T4.pajek, created during the execution of 1\_proposition15.sage, correspond to the tournaments T^1, T^2, T^3 and T^4 respectively.
To execute file yyy.sage, first make sure you have SageMath installed. Then open a SageMath prompt and execute the following command 
  > load("xxx/yyy.sage") 
where "xxx/yyy.sage" corresponds to the path of yyy.sage.
